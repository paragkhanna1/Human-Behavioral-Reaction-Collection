# Human-Behavioral-Reaction-Collection
This dataset collects human behavioral reactions to robotic failures. This data was recorded from a user study and has been processed for anonymization. 
The dataset.csv contains human responses in terms of facial emotional values of the participants for the robot failures as they collaborated with a Baxter robot in a HRC task. The task details are defined in the paper: "User study exploring the role of explanation of failures by robots in human robot collaboration tasks" (workshop, HRI 2023) and further results are reported in the paper: "Effects of Explanation Strategies to Resolve Failures in Human-Robot Collaboration".

TBD: Full dataset, More information about the dataset.csv.
Please email for requesting access to the full datset and for getting more information.
